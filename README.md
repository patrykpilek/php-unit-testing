- [x] Unit testing with PHPUnit: the basics
  - [Installing PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/getting-started/phpunit-9.html)
  - write and run your first test: an introduction to assertions
  - test a function: using multiple assertions
  - [List of PHPUnit assertions](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/assertions.html?highlight=assertions)
  - test that incorrect results are not returned: using multiple test methods
  - test a class: fixing bugs through testing
  - how to name your test methods
- [x] Configuring the PHPUnit test environment
  - the PHPUnit test runner: specify different options when running tests
  - [The PHPUnit XML Configuration file](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/configuration.html?highlight=configuration)
  - configure PHPUnit: the XML configuration file
  - [PHP: sql_autoload_register](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload-register.php)
  - [Composer autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload)
  - autoload classes being tested using Composer
- [x] Test dependencies, fixtures and exceptions
  - unit test a queue class
  - test dependencies: make one test method dependent on another
  - [Fixtures in PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/fixtures.html?highlight=fixtures#fixtures)
  - fixtures: set up the known state of the tests using setUp and tearDown
  - easily add a new test method using the test fixture
  - share fixtures between tests for resource-intensive data
  - [Testing exceptions with PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html?highlight=testing-exceptions#testing-exceptions)
  - testing exceptions: expecting code to throw an exception
- [x] Test doubles: mocks and stubs
  - test doubles: create mock objects to remove dependencies on external resources
  - dependency injection: inject objects that a class depends on
  - [List of PHPUnit mock object matcher methods](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/test-doubles.html?highlight=mock#mock-objects)
  - [List of PHPUnit expectation matcher methods](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/main/src/Framework/Assert.php)
  - test object interactions: verify how a dependency is used
  - [PHPUnit Test Doubles](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/test-doubles.html?highlight=test-doubles)
  - customise the creation of the mock object: the getMockBuilder method
- [x] Mockery - an alternative mocking framework with a human-readable syntax
  - mock a dependency that doesn't exist yet
  - [PHPUnit Test Doubles](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/test-doubles.html?highlight=test-doubles)

  - using Mockery: installation and integration with PHPUnit
  - [Mockery: creating test doubles](http://docs.mockery.io/en/latest/reference/creating_test_doubles.html)
  - using mockery to mock a dependency that doesn't exist yet

  - PHPUnit vs Mockery: Returning different values on subsequent method calls
  - [Mockery Spies](http://docs.mockery.io/en/latest/reference/spies.html)
  - Mockery Spies: make assertions on a call after the event
- [ ] Test-driven development
  - [Test-driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
  - test-driven development: write the test first, then write the code to make it pass
  - write just enough code to make the test pass
- [ ] Testing non-public methods and properties and abstract classes

- [ ] Testing static methods
